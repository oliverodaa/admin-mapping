Due to crazy database-caused errors, I have stopped updating this repo. Instead I am populating this as a static site hosted on my personal website.

Specifically:

It's disappointing, I know, but not much actual functionality has been lost. And with this format, you can easily copy the files to transfer them anywhere. All the heavy lifting is done on the front end by Angular.js.
